class TenantContextMiddleware:
    """Run every request as the `web` database role, with the signed-in user as the database identity.

    Both are transaction-local: the request is wrapped in a transaction, `SET LOCAL ROLE` drops the
    connection to the role that row-level security applies to, and the user id is set the same way, so
    nothing carries over to the next request on a pooled connection. Anonymous requests get an empty
    identity, which matches no company. Place it after AuthenticationMiddleware.

    When the request is already inside an outer transaction (tests), releasing the request's savepoint
    does not undo SET LOCAL, so the role and identity are reset explicitly on the normal path. If a
    database error left the transaction aborted (Django may already have turned it into a 500 response),
    more SQL would only raise and hide the original error, so the request's transaction is marked for
    rollback instead, which undoes them.

    Limits are documented in docs/architecture/tenancy.md: the web role can still change its own setting,
    and a streaming response is read after this middleware returns, outside the role.
