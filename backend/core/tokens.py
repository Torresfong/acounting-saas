"""Single-use, expiring links for password reset and invitations (D40 (5), D48).

The token is random and only its SHA-256 hash is stored. Everything that runs before anyone is signed in
goes through SECURITY DEFINER functions (D40 (2)). Links are built from `settings.BASE_URL`, never from the
request's Host header, so a forged header cannot point an emailed link at another site.
