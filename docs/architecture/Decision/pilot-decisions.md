# Pilot decision log

Decisions settled in the grilling session of 2026-10-27, on the MVP pilot proposal of 2026-10-09. The product spec is in `docs/product/pilot-spec.md`. Each entry gives the decision and the reason.

## Company and legal

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Our company acts as the MyInvois intermediary, not the firm's. | The platform is our product, and holding the intermediary role keeps the client relationship and the commercial position with us. |
| D2 | A Malaysian lawyer reviews the service agreement, the AI and cross-border consent text and the AI data processing agreement by week 12. No client signs before that review. | The pilot sends client documents to an AI provider, possibly abroad, and signs invoices on clients' behalf. |
| D3 | AI processing in Malaysia is preferred, not mandatory. Client consent plus a no-training data processing agreement is the baseline, and the cross-border transfer is named in the consent text and the service agreement. | A mandatory in-region rule would rule out most capable providers. It becomes a hard filter only if the firm or a client requires it. |
| D4 | Records are kept at least 7 years under a written retention agreement. Each client gets a full data export if the pilot ends. | LHDN expects tax records to be kept; clients must never be locked in. |

## Schedule and scope

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D5 | Week 1 starts 2026-10-27. Target gates: 2026-11-09, 2027-01-25 and 2027-02-22. | Dates follow the 17-week plan. |
| D6 | The schedule may slip, with a hard outer limit of about 2027-04-27 (6 months). If Gate 2 slips past week 18, stop and review before hardening. | Lateness is acceptable, but unlimited slip turns the gates into decoration. |
| D7 | Gate 3 moves day for day with the signing certificate and intermediary approval. It is never declared on sandbox results. | The certificate lead time is outside the team's control. |
| D8 | Nothing is cut from scope, including the AI assistant. No cut order is defined. | Decided by the product owner: the whole proposal ships, and time gives instead. |
| D9 | Build in vertical slices, MyInvois first, demoed to the firm by week 6. The assistant comes last. | MyInvois is the riskiest part and everything else depends on it. |

## Stack and operations

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D10 | Django with server-rendered pages, HTMX and Alpine.js, on Postgres 16, with a Postgres-backed job queue and no broker. Replaces the scaffolded FastAPI and Nuxt. | Both developers know basic Python and Postgres, and neither knows Vue or Nuxt. Django adds auth, migrations, forms and translation, and the scaffold was empty so switching was free. |
| D11 | Company isolation uses Postgres row-level security from the first migration. | The proposal promises separate data per company, so the database itself must enforce it. |
| D12 | Hosting is a Malaysian-region public cloud with managed Postgres, probably AWS Malaysia. Daily backups are copied to a second Malaysian zone. | Keeps the residency promise. Service availability in the region is to be confirmed in week 1. |
| D13 | The signing key lives in a key vault, never in the repository, the environment file or a laptop. Sandbox and production use different certificates. Every signing is logged. | One leaked key would compromise every client's invoices. |
| D14 | All MyInvois calls sit behind one module. A two-week sandbox spike comes first. If there is no accepted sandbox submission by week 3, it becomes the top risk. A paid review session with someone who has integrated MyInvois comes before Gate 1. | Nobody on the team has built a government API integration. |
| D15 | Extraction uses a vision-capable model with structured output and no separate OCR engine at first. The provider is chosen in the weeks 1 to 2 sample test. | Fewer parts for two developers. The AI port stays swappable. |
| D16 | Support is business hours, with a one-working-day response target and a weekly developer rotation. If MyInvois is down, submissions queue and the owner sees a status banner. | Real clients and real invoices need a named response path, and silent failure is risky with LHDN's validity window. |

## Product rules

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D17 | Three roles: client owner, client staff, firm accountant. Only the owner approves and submits. No delegation. | Keeps responsibility clear and the audit trail simple. Delegation waits until after the pilot. |
| D18 | The platform is the only invoice issuer for a client after go-live. Numbering is gapless per company and document type, with an owner-set prefix and starting number. | Two issuers would produce duplicate numbers in LHDN and in SQL Account. |
| D19 | Buyer details are copied onto an invoice at approval and locked. | A later customer edit must never change a submitted invoice. |
| D20 | Documents move through fixed states: uploaded, quality-checked, classified, extracted, in review, verified, exported, with returned-for-re-upload and rejected as side states. Only verified documents are exported. The blurry or cropped check runs during the upload. | Bounce within seconds, and no unchecked data in the books. |
| D21 | Exported documents are locked. Later cancellations or corrections appear as new items in the next batch with a "changed after export" flag. No document is exported twice. | Avoids duplicates and silent edits in SQL Account. |
| D22 | Reminders go out on day 3, 7 and 14 after the due date, then stop and flag the accountant. The accountant can pause reminders. | Chasing without nagging the client forever. |
| D23 | The invoice PDF carries the MyInvois QR code and validation link. Email is sent from the platform's domain with the client's name and reply-to. | A validated invoice normally carries both, and using each client's domain is not realistic. |
| D24 | The default exchange-rate source is the Bank Negara Malaysia daily reference rate, unless the firm's SQL Account uses another. | The platform and SQL Account must agree on the rate. To be asked in week 1. |
| D25 | The SQL Account export format is designed only after the firm has hand-built a file that its own SQL Account accepted. The firm names an owner for this by 2026-11-06. | An unverified format would be rework. |

## Assistant

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D26 | The assistant never touches the database. It has four functions: search customers, propose create customer, propose amend customer, and save draft. The backend runs each with the signed-in user's permissions and row-level security, and sends the model only the minimum data. | Limits the damage from a wrong or manipulated model, and limits what is sent to the provider. |
| D27 | The assistant can create and amend customers only through a human-confirmed before-and-after screen, with the TIN validated with MyInvois first. Staff may confirm creating a customer. Only the owner may change a TIN, legal name or registration number. | Customer records feed the legal buyer details on an LHDN invoice. This reverses the proposal's exclusion of assistant-created customers and is an accepted scope increase. |
| D28 | The assistant cannot delete customers, approve or submit invoices, or choose an uncertain tax. Text in uploaded documents is data, never instructions, and extraction output must pass schema validation. Every assistant action is logged. | Highest-risk actions stay with people, and a crafted document cannot steer the model. |

## Success measures

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D29 | Targets accepted as defined: every pilot client has an accepted production e-invoice; one full month imported into SQL Account; 95% or more accepted on first submission (real client invoices only); 80% or more needing no correction, per document type on actual uploads including phone photos; accountant time per document at least halved. A miss on one target is a partial result with a stated cause. | Precise definitions make the targets measurable. |
| D30 | The time baseline is at least 40 documents, timed by week 8 and re-timed on the same set after go-live. | A fair before-and-after comparison. |
| D31 | Each pilot owner states a monthly price they would pay at go-live and again at the end. | A cheap commercial signal at no scope cost. |
| D32 | The firm commits a lead accountant and a named backup, with weekly hours in writing. We shortlist 5 clients and aim to sign 3 to 4, each with a named owner contact by 2026-11-09. | One reviewer is a single point of failure, and one dropout should not cost a target. |

## Testing

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D33 | Three test seams: the web application's HTTP interface with the job runner in-process and four faked ports (seam 1); MyInvois sandbox contract tests (seam 2); an extraction regression harness on the firm-approved sample set (seam 3). CI blocks merges on failures. | Highest-level tests, few seams, and the regression set doubles as evidence for the 80% target. |

## Repository and process

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D34 | Issues and specs live as GitHub issues in `Torresfong/acounting-saas`, using the `gh` CLI. The pilot spec itself is kept as a file in `docs/product/`. | The remote already exists and Issues are enabled. |
| D35 | The repository is a multi-context monorepo with `backend/` as its only context for now, recorded in `docs/agents/domain.md`. | Stated by the product owner. The separate `frontend/` folder was removed when the scaffold moved to Django (D10), because pages are server-rendered. |
| D36 | The job queue is tenant-scoped, not global: jobs carry a company id under row-level security with a web role and a separate worker role; payloads hold identifiers only and failed jobs keep only the exception class. See `docs/adr/0001-job-queue-and-tenancy.md`. | An independent review showed that a global queue lets any tenant request see or queue other tenants' work, and that D11 applies to the queue. The payload and error rules are built in ticket 01; the column, policy and roles come with ticket 02. |
| D37 | `main` is protected: changes arrive only by pull request, the `backend` and `image` checks must pass, and the rule applies to administrators too. Force pushes and deletion are blocked. No approving review is required, since the repository has one owner. | The owner upgraded GitHub and made the repository public, which allows branch protection. Verified on 2026-10-29 with a throwaway PR containing a failing test, which GitHub reported as BLOCKED (issue #26). To push to `main` directly the owner must first relax the rule in repository settings. |
| D38 | The weeks 1 to 2 sample test (D15) compares Claude on AWS Bedrock (lead candidate), Gemini on Google Vertex AI and an OpenAI model on Azure OpenAI, all behind the AI port. Each is scored per document type on field accuracy, schema-valid output rate, cost per document, latency, and Chinese and Malay text. Ties go to the provider with in-region processing and the better no-training data processing agreement terms (D3). The winner is recorded here as a new decision. Self-hosted models and a separate OCR engine are out for the pilot. | Bedrock fits the AWS hosting in D12, but Claude on Bedrock is probably not served from Malaysia, so the cross-border transfer must be named in the consent text (D2, D3). Checked 2026-10-29: Bedrock lists Malaysia (ap-southeast-5) as global cross-region inference only for current Claude models, and no source confirms Gemini data residency in Malaysia (Google's Malaysian region is announced, not confirmed live), so no candidate is confirmed in-region. This shortlists candidates; it does not choose the provider. |
| D39 | AWS is organised as three company-owned accounts under one AWS Organization: management (billing, Organizations and IAM Identity Center only, no workloads), staging (MyInvois sandbox, test data) and production (MyInvois production, real client data). The root user of each account has MFA on two devices held by two people. People sign in through IAM Identity Center and CI deploys through GitHub OIDC, with no long-lived access keys. CloudTrail is on in every account. The Malaysia region (ap-southeast-5) is enabled in each account, and a service control policy denies all regions except Malaysia and the region chosen for AI calls (D38). | Separate accounts give D13 (separate sandbox and production certificates) and D33 a hard boundary, so a staging mistake cannot reach the production signing key or client data. The account is owned by our company, which is the intermediary (D1), not by an individual. The Malaysia region is opt-in and off by default. Service availability there is still being confirmed (see Still open). |
| D40 | Tenant authorization and sign-in. (1) `CompanyAccess(user, company, role)` is the membership table: owners and staff have one row, accountants one row per authorised company, and there is no database bypass role. (2) Every business table uses one RLS pattern: the row's company id must be among the signed-in user's `CompanyAccess` rows. `CompanyAccess` and user records have their own policies, and pre-authentication user lookup goes through a narrowly scoped SECURITY DEFINER function. (3) Django sets the user identity as transaction-local database context. The docs state that the web role can change its own session variable, so SQL injection could impersonate a user; RLS backs up parameterized ORM access and does not replace it. (4) Company-level authorization is RLS; action-level permission is a Django permission service that reads the role from the membership. (5) Django session login with email and password, Argon2 hashing, secure cookies and failed-login throttling. No self-registration: invitations and password setup or reset use expiring, single-use, hashed-token links sent through the email port. One owner per company, by partial unique index. (6) The audit trail records successful and failed logins, logouts and business create and update events, never credentials or tokens, and is append-only for the web role. (7) Two-factor authentication is not in the pilot build, but it is required for client owners and firm accountants before real clients go live (before Gate 3), and go-live is blocked until it is in place. Until then, sign-in ends in one "sign-in complete" step so 2FA plugs in there, and owner approve and submit ask for the password again. | Password-only sign-in is a reasonable choice for 3 to 4 named pilot clients, but an owner login submits legal e-invoices to LHDN and an accountant login reads every client's documents, so a stolen password is not an acceptable production risk. Adding 2FA later needs no change to RLS or membership. A membership table keeps D11 without a bypass role and lets per-accountant assignment and multi-company logins (deferred in the spec) arrive as data changes. |
| D41 | The SQL Account export includes platform-issued sales invoices and old sales invoices uploaded from before the client adopted the platform, alongside verified purchase invoices and receipts. Each company has a go-live date set at onboarding. An uploaded sales invoice dated before it is accepted; one dated on or after it is returned with the reason "issue it in the platform". Uploaded sales invoices use the same pipeline and the same verified-only rule (D20). The export file has a source column: platform-issued or uploaded. Supersedes the "platform-issued only" wording of story 49. | Clients have years of sales invoices in the old books that SQL Account needs, and the platform is the only issuer after go-live (D18), so a cutoff date separates old invoices from duplicates. Decided by the product owner 2026-10-30; a small scope increase (D8). |
| D42 | A batch covers one client and one document-date month. A backlog upload produces several historical batches. A document verified after its month was already exported goes into the next open batch. | Matches how the accountant imports by period, and keeps a bulk backlog from landing in one month. |
| D43 | The export is imported into SQL Account by hand. A batch file can be downloaded repeatedly. Documents become exported and locked only when the accountant confirms the import worked. An unconfirmed batch can be regenerated or voided. The file format is still designed only after the firm's hand-built file is accepted (D25). | The platform cannot see whether a manual import succeeded. Locking on download would leave documents stuck after a failed import, and D21 forbids a second export. |
| D44 | The owner's approval is one action, "Approve & submit": it locks the buyer details (D19), allocates the invoice number and queues the submission. Drafts have no number, so deleting a draft cannot leave a gap. A queued submission shows as submitted (queued) with the outage banner (D16). A cancelled invoice keeps its number and the number is never reused. A corrected invalid invoice is resubmitted under the same number; whether LHDN accepts that is unverified until the sandbox spike (D14). | Gapless numbering per company and document type (D18) needs one clear moment when a number is taken. |
| D45 | Every pilot company is an authorised company for every firm accountant: the accountant gets one `CompanyAccess` row per pilot company (D40(1)), so the review queue lists documents across all clients (story 39) through the same RLS pattern, with no bypass role. Cross-company list screens filter by the accountant's authorised companies. Every read of a company's data by a firm accountant goes to the audit trail. Adding a pilot company means adding that row for each accountant. Refines D40; nothing in D40 changes. | The review queue needs every client at once, and D40 already allows one accountant to hold many `CompanyAccess` rows. An earlier draft proposed a database role that reads every company; it was dropped because D40(1) forbids a bypass role. |
| D46 | Staff and the assistant can propose a change to a customer's TIN, legal name or registration number. The owner approves it, and drafts keep the old values until then. Every customer write path, including the manual form, validates the TIN with MyInvois before saving. Refines D27. | Story 20 (owner approves) and D27 (only the owner may change) disagree; this keeps the owner as the only decider while letting staff do the routine work. |

## Still open

- The AI provider: shortlist in D38, final choice from the weeks 1 to 2 sample test. Whether Gemini and Claude are served from a Malaysian region is unconfirmed.
- The SQL Account version and file format. The import method is manual (D43).
- The exchange-rate source the firm uses today.
- The price after the pilot.
- Whether our company is a registered Malaysian company LHDN will accept as an intermediary. This is assumed, not confirmed.
- Whether AWS Malaysia offers the managed services we need. Checked 2026-10-29: RDS, Fargate, Secrets Manager, ACM, Systems Manager and STS are listed for ap-southeast-5. S3, KMS and SES are not yet confirmed from AWS documentation, and standard RDS for PostgreSQL 16 is inferred from the general RDS listing.
